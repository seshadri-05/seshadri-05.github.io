Our gods may never change. You become mine and I&rsquo;ll become yours. God exists in little things. Peeling tangerines for you, and you&rsquo;ll leave the ripe strawberries for me. Without a ceremony, without a sacrifice, It lives in unspoken trades and exists within the pause between bites. Your hands smell of citrus and my lips are stained red. I doze off each night to the thought of you. I trace your face with my nerves and shut my lids only to see you float right infront of me. Your presence sits like a paperweight made out of glass over the dip between my ribs. Your eyes shrivel up when you smile wide as your cheeks turn red and dissolve the bones holding your face uptight.
Should I call this drunk on love or is it a form of sleep paralysis idk</p><h2><a href=/posts/things_i_think_of_while_doing_the_dishes/>Things I think of while doing the dishes</a></h2><p>Dreamed my house was on fire and the only thing I saved was a photograph of us together.</p><p>Waiting together is a love language. Wait with me while the train arrives so that we can talk a little longer. wait for dinner with me, we can slow dance in the kitchen. wait for me when things gets rough, I know I can get through this (with you). wait with me till parents come to pick us up so that we can hold hands a little longer.</p><h2><a href=/posts/coco/>Coco</a></h2><p>Me Core

For me, what I know is, love is slow, gradual. It&rsquo;s seeing them chase their passions and ambitions and quietly hoping and praying they suceed. It&rsquo;s listening to them with eyes full of love as they go off on a tangent about their new fixations. In my mind, there is no grand wedding or outright declaration of love. But there are glimses of us shopping for ice creams, holding hands, a smile never fading off from lips, peeling off oranges for each other, having conversations with heavy gazes, it isn&rsquo;t something temporal or fleeting, instead its slow and forever.</p></main><footer><p>Copyright 2026.
