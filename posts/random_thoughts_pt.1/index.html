I have never known. For me, what I know is, love is slow, gradual. It&rsquo;s seeing them chase their passions and ambitions and quietly hoping and praying they suceed. It&rsquo;s listening to them with eyes full of love as they go off on a tangent about their new fixations. In my mind, there is no grand wedding or outright declaration of love. But there are glimses of us shopping for ice creams, holding hands, a smile never fading off from lips, peeling off oranges for each other, having conversations with heavy gazes, it isn&rsquo;t something temporal or fleeting, instead its slow and forever.</p><p>[p.s - I wanna go on writing so long about this but i wanna save this up for later]</p><p>A second thought:
Are we always performing?</p><p>when I was eight, I used to spend afternoons sitting on the cold marble floor of my home&rsquo;s balcony, sunrays from the window shinning directly through my hair, with a sketchbook that was too nice for me. I would copy pictures from magazines - a bowl of fruits, a boquet of flowers, sometimes the front of a house and the proportions were always wrong, the fruits looked deflated, the flowers looked more like plants, and the windows crooked. But these hours dangled, like time had agreed to pause long enough for me to exist without trying to win at anything. I didn&rsquo;t think of it as art or talent. I just liked the way my pencil moved, the way graphite smudged on my fingers, and the little thrill of seeing something appear on the paper.
I stopped drawing when I grew up. I learnt about hobbies and hobbies, apparently, needed to be mastered to matter. Suddenly everything required a purpose, a measurable improvement curve. You couldn&rsquo;t just paint around, you had to be &ldquo;getting better at it&rdquo;. You couldn&rsquo;t just read poetry, you had to underline passages and post them to prove you were thoughtful. Being average stopped being acceptable, and joy quietly turned into a performance.</p><p>Lives I want to live in maybe some other lives</p><p>There&rsquo;s a life where I&rsquo;m a music teacher in a sleepy Midwest town, and I spend evenings tuning pianos and playing Chopin for the moonlight that spills in through my windows. The students come and go, but I remember their names. I know the ones who cry when their fingers can&rsquo;t find the notes. I remind them that&rsquo;s a part of learning that feeling.</p><p>Another life: I am in New York. A freelance writer living off late night Chinese takeout and unpaid invoices, but God, I write things that matter. I write about lonliness and lust and the sound of trains at 2 a.m. I write about the way strangers meet eyes and how some silences hold more weight than full conversations. Maybe no one reads me. Maybe the right person does.</p><p>Dreamed my house was on fire and the only thing I saved was a photograph of us together.</p></article></main><footer><p>Copyright 2026.
