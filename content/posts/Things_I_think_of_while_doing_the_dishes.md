Dreamed my house was on fire and the only thing I saved was a photograph of us together.




Waiting together is a love language. Wait with me while the train arrives so that we can talk a little longer. wait for dinner with me, we can slow dance in the kitchen. wait for me when things gets rough, I know I can get through this (with you). wait with me till parents come to pick us up so that we can hold hands a little longer. 



What if everything is intentional. What if dancing to music alone in your room matters as much as writing an essay for yourself, what if a someone you never knew comes into your life and loves you for being yourself, what if that someone makes soup for you, what if tears are sacred. what if its all love.



I think being an author for little kids would be so fun. yes i will write about bears sharing a home together and being friends with trees. Maqybe they make a delicious soup. There's an illustration of animals hugging while the sun sets and little kids read it and feel life is good. Love is good. 


idk i just wanna sit in a dark library in a oversized sweater and smile at my lover over the top of my book as a storm rages outside and a fire crackles at the fireplace and i feel warm and safe and loved is that too much to ask for 



I think one of my favourite emotions with my boyfriend is that when one of us does something foolish (its actually cute), and all we can say is, "you are so cute i love you"


You are my blue crayon, the one i never get enough of, the one i  always use to colour my sky.
