Our opinions on god may falter. Our gods may never change. You become mine and I'll become yours. God exists in little things. Peeling tangerines for you, and you'll leave the ripe strawberries for me. Without a ceremony, without a sacrifice, It lives in unspoken trades and exists within the pause between bites. Your hands smell of citrus and my lips are stained red. I doze off each night to the thought of you. I trace your face with my nerves and shut my lids only to see you float right infront of me. Your presence sits like a paperweight made out of glass over the dip between my ribs. Your eyes shrivel up when you smile wide as your cheeks turn red and dissolve the bones holding your face uptight. 
Should I call this drunk on love or is it a form of sleep paralysis idk
