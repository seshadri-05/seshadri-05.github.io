&lt;p&gt;Waiting together is a love language. Wait with me while the train arrives so that we can talk a little longer. wait for dinner with me, we can slow dance in the kitchen. wait for me when things gets rough, I know I can get through this (with you). wait with me till parents come to pick us up so that we can hold hands a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Coco</title><link>https://seshadri-05.github.io/posts/coco/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 17:00:52 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://seshadri-05.github.io/posts/coco/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Me Core

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t. I have never known. For me, what I know is, love is slow, gradual. It&amp;rsquo;s seeing them chase their passions and ambitions and quietly hoping and praying they suceed. It&amp;rsquo;s listening to them with eyes full of love as they go off on a tangent about their new fixations. In my mind, there is no grand wedding or outright declaration of love. But there are glimses of us shopping for ice creams, holding hands, a smile never fading off from lips, peeling off oranges for each other, having conversations with heavy gazes, it isn&amp;rsquo;t something temporal or fleeting, instead its slow and forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
