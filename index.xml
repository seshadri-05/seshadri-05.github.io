&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t. I have never known. For me, what I know is, love is slow, gradual. It&amp;rsquo;s seeing them chase their passions and ambitions and quietly hoping and praying they suceed. It&amp;rsquo;s listening to them with eyes full of love as they go off on a tangent about their new fixations. In my mind, there is no grand wedding or outright declaration of love. But there are glimses of us shopping for ice creams, holding hands, a smile never fading off from lips, peeling off oranges for each other, having conversations with heavy gazes, it isn&amp;rsquo;t something temporal or fleeting, instead its slow and forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
